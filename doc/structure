KeyDB:
- blockchain:
	- block-size: 1 publickey
	- hash function: argon2d-512bit
	- hash-params: 8GB, 8 threads, (TBD) [Target: 1s/hash]
	- hash-difficulty: 1valid hash/3600s
	- block-structure:
		- header:
			- prev-hash: hash
			- timestamp: Timestamp
			- nonce: Nonce 128bit
		- body:
			- key: PublicKey (max 4096bit)
			- type [16bit]: crypto.type_t
			- purpose: user, node, etc.
		- footer:
			- hash: hash
			- signature: Signature of the hash
	- rules:
		2 blocks have the same prev-hash, longest chain is valid
RevDB:
- simple (key, val1) DB (no blockchain)
- sorted by key
- append only
- items are immutable
- Item:
	- key: hash of block in KeyDB
	- value: Signed revocation of the key (signed by the owner)
- rules:
	- key has to be in KeyDB
	- the sha512 of the db [key1, val1, key2, val2, ...] and the modification timestamp is used to know if it is up to date
UserDB:
- SQL (key, val1, val2, val3) DB (no blockchain)
- sorted by key
- items are mutable
- items never expire
- Item:
	- key: hash of block in KeyDB
	- val1[64bit]: unix timestamp of latest modification
	- val2[128KiB]: public user data
	- val3: signature
- rules:
	- key has to be in KeyDB
	- the sha512 of the db [key1, val1, val2, val3, key2, ...] and the modification timestamp is used to know if it is up to date
	- if key is in RevDB, item is invalid and can be deleted.

MsgNet:
- regular DB (no blockchain)
- hash function: argon2d-512bit
- hash-params: 1GB, 4 thread, (TBD) [Target: 0.001s/hash]
- hash-difficulty: 1valid hash/(1s*128KiBweek)
