KeyDB:
- simple (key, val1, val2)
	-val1 is a public key of one of the follwing types: Ed448, ML-DSA, SLH-DSA
	-key is the POW argon2d hash of val1 (params to be determined later)
	-val2 is key signed by val1
- rules
	- val1 has to be valid
	- val2 has to be a valid signature using val1
	- key has to be a valid POW hash.
	- key will be used as an identifier of this public cyrptographic key in the following dbs

RevDB:
- simple (key, val1) DB (no blockchain)
- sorted by key
- append only
- items are immutable
- Item:
	- key: hash of block in KeyDB
	- value: Signed revocation of the key (signed by the owner)
- rules:
	- key has to be in KeyDB
	- the sha512 of the db [key1, val1, key2, val2, ...] and the modification timestamp is used to know if it is up to date
UserDB:
- SQL (key, val1, val2, val3) DB (no blockchain)
- sorted by key
- items are mutable
- items never expire
- Item:
	- key: hash of block in KeyDB
	- val1[64bit]: unix timestamp of latest modification
	- val2[128KiB]: public user data
	- val3: signature
- rules:
	- key has to be in KeyDB
	- the sha512 of the db [key1, val1, val2, val3, key2, ...] and the modification timestamp is used to know if it is up to date
	- if key is in RevDB, item is invalid and can be deleted.

MsgNet:
- regular DB (no blockchain)
- hash function: argon2d-512bit
- hash-params: 1GB, 4 thread, (TBD) [Target: 0.001s/hash]
- hash-difficulty: 1valid hash/(1s*128KiBweek)
